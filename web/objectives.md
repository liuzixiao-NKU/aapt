---++ Objectives for the Student Learning Path

 * Students understand the connection between gravitational waves
   and compact object mergers
   
 * Students identify the connection between lower frequency signals
   and lower frequency motion at the source in both sound and
   gravitational waves

 * Students recognize that the frequency of a gravitational wave signal
   reveals the mass of the source

 * Students can interpert time-domain plots of gravitational wave data

 * Students can interpert time-frequency plots of gravitational wave data
