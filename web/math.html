	Musical instruments (and many other sources of sound) use
	<i>resonance</i> to amplify sound.  Every object has a series of
	natural resonant frequencies.  Musical instruments are designed
	so their resonant frequencies will correspond to a set of musical notes.	
	<br/><br/>
	In most cases, the lowest resonant frequency will correspond
	to the round trip travel time for sound through the object.
	For a wind instrument (like a piccolo or a bassoon),
	this is the time for a sound wave to travel round trip from one end to the other.
	Finding this frequency is equivalent to finding a wave whose wavelength "fits"
	on the instrument - for example, the size of the instrument is half of a wavelength.
	So, longer wavelengths resonate with larger sources, which is why lower pitches
	often come from larger objects.
	<br/><br/>

	<ol>
	  <li> You can model a piccolo as a hollow cyclinder, 30 cm long.  How long is this in meters?
	  <li> The speed of sound in air is around 300 m/s.  Calculate the round-trip travel time
	    for sound down-and-back the length of the piccolo.  (Hint: distance = rate X time)
	  <li> Use this time to estimate the lowest frequency a piccolo can play ( f = 1/T )
	  <li> Use an <a href='https://onlinetonegenerator.com' target=_blank>online tone generator</a> to listen
	    to this frequency.  Does it sound like a note a piccolo could play?
	  <li> Repeat this for a bassoon, which has a path for sound about 2 m long.
	  <li> Play the bassoon's lowest pitch on the tone generator.  Does it sound like a note a bassoon could make?

	Let's look at two ways to display the same signal.
	The first figure shows a "time-domain" plot of a sound wave,
	with amplitude on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. You can measure the

	can do this by dividing the time shown by how many peaks are shown.

	This figure shows a time-frequency plot of the data, known
	as a spectrogram.  You can see the signal as the bright, yellow band.

	Just like the frequency of a musical note can tell us about the size of the instrument, the frequency of a gravitational wave
	signal can tell us about the size of binary black holes.  Each cycle of a graviatational wave signals corresponds to
	one half orbit of a binary black hole.  You can see this in the video - a gravitational wave "crest" leaves the system each time
	a black hole passes by.  So, the period of the gravitational wave signal is always twice the period of the binary orbit:
	<br/><br/>
	2 * T<sub>GW</sub> = T<sub>orbit</sub>

	<br/><br/>
	The plots show the same simulated signal for a binary black merger, in the time domain and spectrogram plots.  As the black holes
	get closer, they orbit faster, so the frequency goes up near the merger time (the black holes merger near time 1.7 s).
	<br/><br/>
	<ol>
	  <li> Using the plots at right to estimate the gravitational wave period near merger. [Hint: What's the highest frequency in the spectrogram?]</li>
	  <li> Calcuate the orbital period.  This is twice the gravitational wave period.
	  <li> Near merger, black holes always move really, really fast - around 10<sup>8</sup> m/s.  This is around 1/3 the speed of light (!!)  Use this
	    velocity to estimate the orbital radius of the black holes [Hint: distance = rate X time].
	  <li> Is the radius you calculated closer to the size of a car, a city, a planet, or a star?  Imagine an object this size, spinning around
	    100 times per second.  What would it look like?
	  <li> The orbital radius near merger can be related to the black hole mass using the "ISCO" radius, r<sub>ISCO</sub> = 6GM / c<sup>2</sup>.
	    Assuming the orbital radius you calculated is the ISCO radius, estimate the mass of these black holes.  G is Newton's constant,
	    c is the speed of light.
	  <li> Divide your answer by the mass of our sun to estimate the mass in units of "solar masses"
	  <li> The masses used to genenate this signal are similar to parameters for GW150914 (well ... within a factor of 2).  Take a look at
	    <a href='https://www.gw-openscience.org/eventapi/html/GWTC-1-confident/GW150914/v3/' target='_blank'>the real GW150914 data</a>.  You can see the masses
	    by clicking "show parameters".  How do the spectrograms and masses of GW150914 compare with what you did here?
